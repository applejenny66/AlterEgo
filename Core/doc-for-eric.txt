check the code on the server is the latest
    - usually I ran two commands in the folder SilentSpeech
        - git fetch
        - git reset --hard origin/master
    - these two commands can force the code on the server to be in sync with the code on the github

collecting the data (locally)
    - all data are stored in the SilentSpeech\OpenBCI_GUI_orson\OpenBCI_GUI\SavedDataOrson
        (run once openBCI GUI, generate one data file)
    - usually the file for 500 data points should be 40-60 MB
    - open the remove.py script to remove noise like gulping
        - modify the name in the line 2 and line 10 (rename the file to some simpler name such as "Digits0109.txt")
    - now we can used the data file (say, Digits0109.txt)
    - you can first copy-paste it into "SilentSpeech\data_raw\" locally [optionally]. But you NEED to upload it to the server and put it into "SilentSpeech\data_raw\"

digits_keras_no_shuffle_feature_selection.py (on the server)
    - digits classifier training
        - change the dataset file name in the code (line 190)
        - change the output model name in the code (if using cnn, line 330)

vad_fused_keras_no_shuffle.py (on the server, recommend run the vad_fused_keras_no_shuffle_for_demo.py instead)
    - vad classifier training
        - change the dataset file name in the code (line 25)
        - change the output model name in the code (line 234 for vad_fused_keras_no_shuffle.py, line 170 for vad_fused_keras_no_shuffle_for_demo.py)

these two files need to be run seperately. You can see the results of the training in the "SilentSpeech\log\"

After training, pull the models (one for digits classifier and one for vad classifier) from the server (usually should be in the SilentSpeech/models folder) to local laptop.


realtime_processing.py (locally)
    - change the names of the models that were just pulled from the server


pipeline for new data collection
    - prepare the sentence
    - prepare the SilentSpeech\OpenBCI_GUI_orson\OpenBCI_GUI\dic\corpus.txt (index,sentence)
